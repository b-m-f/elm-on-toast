# Elm development with toast

This project wraps an Elm Development environment using [toast](https://github.com/stepchowfun/toast).

To install it follow the steps in the [toast repository](https://github.com/stepchowfun/toast#installation). If you have cargo installed, simply run `cargo install toast`.


All you need to do to start developing is to run `toast`. This will download all necessary tools defined in `toast.yml` and start the development server using `elm reactor` at `localhost:3000`.
